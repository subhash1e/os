Operating System is the only 
thing that makes your bare metal
(desktop, tablet, phone, etc) run, be used to work with.


Think of Operating System as knowing how a car works,
which surely you won't need to drive the car. 

But it will be helpful when you get into trouble while driving.

..knowing how your pc works doesnt help in how to operate pc , but 
will help while trouble in operating
