An Operating System 
is a software that acts a
s an interface between computer hardware components and the user.

Every computer system must have at least one operating system
to run other programs.

Applications like Browsers, MS Office, Notepad Games, etc.,
need some environment to run and perform its tasks.

Picture it like how she (Operating System) handles all the household chores
and delegate some of her tasks to her maid (Kernel).

OS

Operating System helps to communicate with the
computer without knowing the computer's language.

There are many systems for which Operating Systems 
are designed for such as Personal Computers(PC), 
Mobile Phones, Workstations, Servers, and WSCs(Warehouse scale computers).

Kernel

A Kernel is a special program 
(a person like your maid), who has some extra privileges,
which handles most of the tasks (Random-access memory, 
Input/Output devices, Resource Management, Memory Management,
Device Management), and in case of your maid (mopping the floor,
cleaning the bathroom and bringing the veggies, etc.) 
delegated by the Operating System (The Homemaker)

    types of OS
    
    
 1>Simple Batch Systems   
The user fed an input to the computer operator, who gathered similar jobs(tasks to be performed) 
and placed an entire batch (group of similar type tasks) 

for utilization by the monitor. 
2>Time-Sharing Systems

It has been developed to provide user 
interaction directly with the computer.

Since, In batch multiprogramming, 
we used to provide JCL (Job control commands) with the job.

But things like transaction processing,
we needed user-interaction.

Therefore the concept of 
time-sharing has been introduced.
In this, a system clock generated
interrupts at a rate of around one every 0.2 seconds.

3>Real-Time Operating System

In a real-time system, 
the time interval between input request and output is very small,

so these systems can be used in 
time constraint places like military software systems,
space softwares, etc.

4>Distributed Operating System

In distributed various computers,
interconnected with each other 
communicate with each other through
the shared communication network.

Each machine has its own
processors and memory
unit for fast computation.

These are also known as distributed systems.
